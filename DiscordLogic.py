""" Runebot is a discord webhook bot which tracks player achievements such as levels and boss/activity counts
This was developed by runescape player "Jelapeeno" as a side project to develop skills, this bot is in no way the
most efficient version of itself as using json rather than an SQLite database in order to store data is not ideal.
However this bot was created to gain experience and for private use solely developed by the author listed below.

@Version : 2.1.1

PLEASE LOOK AT README FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO SETUP THE BOT FOR PRIVATE USE WITHIN A DISCORD
